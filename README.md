Starter Project for Comp 55

COMP 129 REMASTERED CHANGES README UPDATED:
In this remastered version for the class COMP 129 (Software Engineering) I am adding an additional feature.
In the orginal game, it always begins after the user clicks on the Play button starting from Level 1. This cannot be changed currently and so you must always begin from level 1 when booting up the game. 
The feature to be added is for the user to have the ability to choose the level from which they want to start from. Rather than always having to start from the 1st level even after beating the game, Level Selection will be added to give the user more freedom in how the game will be played as opposed to keeping it more linear.

You will use this project as your base.
